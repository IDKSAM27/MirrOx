STUFF: 

match
-----
match is a control flow operator used for pattern matching. It works similarily to switch in C++,
used to match complex patterns, including enums, results, and custom types.
Ok(_) : _ means ignore the value
Err(e) : e captures the error message and prints it

It is equivalent to using 'if let'

if let Err(e) = adb::check_adb() {
    eprintln!("Error : {}", e);
} else {
    println!("ADB is available)
}
