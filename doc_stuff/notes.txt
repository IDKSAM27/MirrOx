# scrcpy working:

MediaProjection API (Android 5+)
    Scrcpy uses the MediaProjection API, which is the official way to capture the screen.
    This API provides a virtual display, which Scrcpy captures and encodes.

H.264 / H.265 Hardware Encoding (Faster than Raw Frames)
    Scrcpy does not send raw frames (like screencap does, which is slow).
    Instead, it compresses frames using the phoneâ€™s hardware encoder (MediaCodec) before sending them over ADB.

Efficient ADB Data Transfer
    Instead of saving frames as PNG/JPEG, Scrcpy streams an H.264 video over ADB.
    It uses an efficient ADB socket connection to minimize latency.

Decoding & Displaying on PC
    On the PC, Scrcpy decodes the H.264 stream using FFmpeg or OpenGL and renders it in real-time.

# Minicap

* Third-party library (not part of Android's official APIs).
* Uses Android's private SurfaceFlinger API to capture frames.
* Requires root access on some devices.
* Faster than screencap, but less efficient than MediaProjection.
* Used in older screen mirroring tools (before MediaProjection became available).

# MediaProjection API (Official Android API)

* Official Android API (available since Android 5.0 - Lollipop).
* Allows apps to capture the screen without root.
* Used by Scrcpy & other modern mirroring tools.
* More efficient and fully supported by Android.
* Can leverage hardware encoding for low-latency streaming.

Since Minicap is outdated and sometimes requires root, it's not the best choice.

Instead, we should use the MediaProjection API + H.264 encoding (like Scrcpy).

This will greatly reduce latency and improve performance.
