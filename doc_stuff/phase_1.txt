Let's start with a barebones Android server that captures the screen and streams it over a socket.

We'll use:

    MediaProjection API for screen capture;

    MediaCodec for H.264 encoding:
        Initialize MediaCodec for H.264 encoding
        Use MediaProjection to capture the screen
        Feed captured frames to MediaCodec
        Extract encoded H.264 data and stream it

    AudioRecord for audio capture

    Socket (TCP/UDP/WebSockets) for streaming

PERMISSIONS IN ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML
Why These Permissions?
FOREGROUND_SERVICE → Required for running a foreground service (ScreenCaptureService.java) that captures the screen.
INTERNET → Needed to send the captured screen/audio data to your Rust client.
RECORD_AUDIO → Required if you also want to capture and stream audio from the device.
