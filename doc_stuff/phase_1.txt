Let's start with a barebones Android server that captures the screen and streams it over a socket.

We'll use:

    MediaProjection API for screen capture;

    MediaCodec for H.264 encoding:
        Initialize MediaCodec for H.264 encoding
        Use MediaProjection to capture the screen
        Feed captured frames to MediaCodec
        Extract encoded H.264 data and stream it

        Steps for MediaProjection Integration
            Request screen capture permission in MainActivity.java.
            Start ScreenCaptureService and pass the permission token.
            Modify ScreenCaptureService.java to use MediaProjection.
            Feed frames into MediaCodec for encoding.

    Socket (TCP/UDP/WebSockets) for streaming:
        Steps to Implement Streaming to Rust
        1. Set up a TCP server in Android
            The server will listen for incoming connections from the Rust client.
            It will send H.264 frames as they are encoded.

        2. Modify MediaProjection Service
            After encoding each frame, send it over the socket instead of storing it.

        3. Handle network buffering & errors
            Ensure proper error handling and reconnection logic.

        4. Modify Rust client to receive the stream
            Establish a TCP connection to the Android server.
            Read H.264 packets, decode them, and render using wgpu.

        I'll write the necessary Java code for this.
            This Java class sets up a TCP server that listens for a connection from the Rust client.
                * When a client connects, it sends H.264 encoded frames via sendFrame(byte[] data).
                * We will call sendFrame() inside the MediaProjection capture logic.

    AudioRecord for audio capture:

PERMISSIONS IN ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML
Why These Permissions?
FOREGROUND_SERVICE → Required for running a foreground service (ScreenCaptureService.java) that captures the screen.
INTERNET → Needed to send the captured screen/audio data to your Rust client.
RECORD_AUDIO → Required if you also want to capture and stream audio from the device.
