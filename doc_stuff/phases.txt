Updated Plan for MirrOx with Audio & Low Latency
Since we need to handle both screen and audio mirroring while reducing latency, let's break it down into structured phases:

Phase 1: Android Server for Efficient Screen & Audio Capture
    We will write a lightweight Android server that efficiently captures and streams screen & audio data.

    1. Screen Capture (Low Latency)

        Use MediaProjection API to capture the screen.

        Encode using MediaCodec (H.264 / H.265) for efficient streaming.

        Stream over TCP/WebSockets/RTSP.

    2. Audio Capture

        Use AAudio or AudioRecord API to capture system audio.

        Encode using AAC (or Opus).

        Stream over TCP/WebSockets (preferably in sync with video).

Phase 2: Rust Client for Decoding & Rendering
    We will modify MirrOx to receive and process both video & audio streams.

    1. Receive & Decode Video Stream

        Use FFmpeg, GStreamer, or AV1 decoder in Rust.

        Utilize wgpu/vulkan for GPU acceleration.

    2. Receive & Play Audio Stream

        Use CPAL or rodio for audio playback.

        Synchronize with video using timestamps.

Phase 3: Optimize Latency

    1. Bypass screencap for raw framebuffer access (optional)

    2. Optimize H.264 encoding settings for minimal delay

    3. Use UDP instead of TCP/WebSockets for low-latency streaming

    4. Implement frame skipping & buffering mechanisms

    5. Utilize Vulkan/WGPU for hardware-accelerated decoding

Next Step: Implement Android Server
Since MirrOx already handles receiving frames, the first step is to write the Android server to stream both screen and audio efficiently.
